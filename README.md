# Image Captioning with Speech Synthesis

This task is for image captioning using a trained model and converting the generated captions to speech.

## Overview

Image captioning is the process of generating textual descriptions or captions for images. 
This project utilizes a pre-trained model and tokenizer to generate captions for input images. Additionally, the generated captions can be converted to speech using text-to-speech synthesis.
